You wanted a practice to create a solution.
We already discussed that a blog api would be nice.

These are the things that you need to develop then:
- Web Api for Creating a blog, fields will be Title, etc.
- Post that can be added / deleted from a blog, that does not have to be fancy, just date, title content etc.
- Comments that can be added to a post, by users with a valid email adress.

For this to work, you will need to create an EF-Core Repository.
Set it up with Model First, so it will create the database tables for you.
Split it up in at least these BlogRepository, PostRepository and CommentRepository
Then Create a Service using these Repositories.
Your WebApi will talk to this service only. Not directly to the Repository.
Set it up with the default Dependency Injection used in .net.

You can test it all with postman.

If you want a frontend- talking to it, try to look at Blazor or MIUI.. But that is not needed.

Ofc a lot of this you will need to be learing online, practice what you've seen in the courses. 
And ask questions if you are stuck..
